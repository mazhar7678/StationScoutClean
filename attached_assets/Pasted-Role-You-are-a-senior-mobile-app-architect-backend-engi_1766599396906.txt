Role:
You are a senior mobile app architect, backend engineer, QA lead, and technical product manager combined.
Your task is to fully understand, audit, and plan the completion of this mobile app project.
________________________________________
🎯 PRIMARY GOAL
Take stock of every development file in this repository and create a clear, step by step roadmap to:
1.	Fully build
2.	Fully test
3.	Fully deploy
the mobile app into a production ready state.
Assume this project is unfinished, messy, and possibly broken.
________________________________________
🔍 WHAT YOU MUST DO (IN ORDER)
1️⃣ FULL CODEBASE AUDIT
Carefully review every file and every line of code, including but not limited to:
•	Frontend (mobile app UI)
•	Backend services
•	APIs and endpoints
•	Database schemas and queries
•	Authentication and authorization
•	Configuration files
•	Environment variables
•	Build and deployment scripts
•	Test files (or missing tests)
✅ Do not skip files
✅ Do not assume intent — infer it from the code
________________________________________
2️⃣ IDENTIFY ISSUES & PROBLEMS
Create a clear list of:
•	❌ Bugs or broken logic
•	⚠️ Code smells or risky patterns
•	🧹 Redundant or unused code
•	🔁 Duplicate logic or components
•	🛣️ Redundant or unused API routes/endpoints
•	🔌 Broken or incomplete backend integrations
•	🔐 Security issues (auth, secrets, permissions)
•	🐢 Performance problems
•	📦 Missing dependencies or misconfigurations
Explain each issue in plain English, as if teaching a beginner.
________________________________________
3️⃣ BACKEND & INTEGRATION REVIEW
For the backend:
•	List all endpoints and routes
•	Explain what each one does
•	Identify: 
o	Endpoints that are unused
o	Endpoints that do the same thing
o	Endpoints that should exist but don’t
•	Check how the frontend talks to the backend
•	Identify broken, partial, or unsafe integrations
________________________________________
4️⃣ DATA & STATE REVIEW
•	Explain how data flows through the app
•	Identify missing, duplicated, or unnecessary data
•	Check database structure and usage
•	Highlight data validation problems
________________________________________
5️⃣ TECHNICAL CLEANUP PLAN
Propose a clear cleanup strategy, including:
•	What code should be deleted
•	What should be rewritten
•	What can be kept but improved
•	What must be added to finish the app properly
________________________________________
🗺️ FINAL DELIVERABLES (VERY IMPORTANT)
A) TECHNICAL ROADMAP (STEP BY STEP)
Create a numbered roadmap with phases such as:
1.	Code cleanup
2.	Backend fixes
3.	Frontend fixes
4.	Feature completion
5.	Testing
6.	Deployment
Each step must include:
•	✅ What to do
•	🛠️ Which files are involved
•	🎯 The expected outcome
________________________________________
B) TESTING PLAN
Explain:
•	What types of tests are needed (unit, integration, end to end)
•	What parts of the app need tests first
•	What tools or frameworks should be used
•	What “done and safe” looks like
Keep explanations simple and beginner friendly.
________________________________________
C) DEPLOYMENT PLAN
Explain how to:
•	Prepare the app for production
•	Set up environment variables safely
•	Build the app
•	Deploy backend and frontend
•	Verify deployment worked
Assume no prior deployment experience.
________________________________________
D) TECHNICAL BRIEF (FOR DEVELOPERS)
Create a clear technical summary that explains:
•	What the app does
•	How the system works
•	Key technologies used
•	Known risks and constraints
________________________________________
E) USER BRIEF (FOR NON TECHNICAL PEOPLE)
Create a simple explanation that a 15 year old could understand:
•	What the app is for
•	What users can do
•	What problems it solves
•	What still needs to be built
Use plain language. Avoid jargon.
________________________________________
🧠 IMPORTANT RULES
•	Be honest — if something is broken or missing, say so
•	Be specific — name files, functions, routes, and components
•	Be clear — no vague advice
•	Be focused — only recommend what is actually needed
•	Explain why something matters, not just what to do
